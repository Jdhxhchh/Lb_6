1. Understand the Requirements:
   - Clearly understand the requirements of the cinema application, which involves managing a cinema with multiple halls, rows, and seats.

2. Plan the Structure:
   - Plan the overall structure of the code, identifying key classes and methods needed for the cinema application.

3. Create the CinemaApp Class:
   - Start by creating the `CinemaApp` class, which will represent the cinema and handle operations like booking seats, canceling bookings, checking availability, and printing seating arrangements.

4. Design the Methods:
   - Design the methods within the `CinemaApp` class based on the specified functionality (e.g., `bookSeats`, `cancelBooking`, `checkAvailability`, `printSeatingArrangement`).

5. Implement the Main Application:
   - Create a separate class, for example, `CinemaApplication`, to serve as the entry point for the application.
   - Instantiate the `CinemaApp` class in the `main` method of `CinemaApplication` and demonstrate the usage of various methods.

6. Test the Code:
   - Test the code by booking and canceling seats, checking seat availability, and printing seating arrangements.
   - Ensure that the code behaves as expected and handles different scenarios.

7. Refine and Optimize:
   - Review the code for clarity, correctness, and efficiency.
   - Refactor the code if needed to improve readability and maintainability.

8. Document the Code:
   - Add comments to the code to explain complex logic, assumptions, or important details.
   - Write clear documentation for classes and methods.

9. Version Control (Optional):
   - If using version control (e.g., Git), commit the code with descriptive commit messages.

10. Bonus Functionality (Optional):
    - If attempting the bonus tasks (e.g., `findBestAvailable`, `autoBook`), plan and implement these additional features.

11. Test Additional Scenarios:
    - Test the application with different scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.

12. Solicit Feedback (Optional):
    - Share the code with peers or mentors to gather feedback and suggestions for improvement.
